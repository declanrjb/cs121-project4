To Do List:
( ) healing items (2 points): Create items that players can use to restore health. These items should only be usable once each and should disappear when used.
( ) introducing monsters during play (2 points): Make it so that over time new monsters appear in the world.
- This can be when thoughts are placed in the excuses room
( ) loot (3 points): Make it so that defeating some monsters causes useful items to appear. There should be some amount of randomness about what those items are.
( ) more monsters (3 points): Create several different types of monsters. They should not just have different names, but really be different in important ways.
( ) player attributes (3 points): By default the only characteristic of the player is their health. Add more attributes that affect what the player can do.
(x) characters (4 points): Characters are neutral beings in the game that you can talk to and interact with. (The “talking to” can be a matter of picking one of several options of things to say from a list.) They should interact with you or the world in some way when you talk to them. This should be different than the “helper” above (that is, if you make a helper character, then you need another character to get credit for this option).
